# PDB New Search API Query with Very Simple Python Example
This is a basic example of querying the RCSB PDB using the new (2021) search API with a Python 3 program and json file. I'm not affliated with the PDB, but I just wish there was a simple Python example posted somewhere so I made one. Here's their documentation: https://search.rcsb.org/#search-api

You will need:
- Python 3 (this was made using 3.7.2)
- requests, json, and pprint (I believe you can pip install each of these if you don't already have them)

Notes: 
- This was only tested in a Windows environment. 
- Again, I am not affliated with the PDB, if you have questions about querying or results you should contact them
- Here's a link to their "Web Services Overview" page with more infomraiton and a contact link at the bottom: https://www.rcsb.org/pages/webservices
